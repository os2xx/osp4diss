# OS Week 05 Assignment #2: How Low (Memory) Can You Go?

* How much (minimum) RAM is needed to boot your Debian Guest?
* Rename your Debian Virtual Guest to (e.g.) "LOW-MEMORY"
  * Try to boot the Virtual Guest with Memory Base size 999 MB. [See setting System:Motherboard](DebianGuestOnVirtualBox3.md#idx01).
    * 512 MB?
    * 256 MB?
    * and less?
    * Point 1: take note (how much memory) when the linux kernel still boots but with unusual messages.
    * Point 2: take note (how much memory) when the linux kernel went panic.
* Boot the linux kernel with about 10-20% more Memory Base above point 1.
    * E.g., if point 1 = 500MB, then boot with 550 MB memory.
